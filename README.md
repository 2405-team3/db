# Paisley

Paisley is an open-source framework to help IT or engineering teams quickly set up and deploy chatbots that integrate their data. It achieves this through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

Our RAG “starter-kit” enables teams to skip some of the research, easily establish knowledge bases, and more quickly deploy and iterate on RAG chatbots.

## Setup
The easiest way to setup Paisley using our CLI.
